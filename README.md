⚠️THIS PROGRAM OPENS A LOT (A LOT) OF WINDOWS ON AUTO MODE. SO MANY THAT THE KILL KEY DOESNT WORK ANYMORE. RUN HIGH SPEEDS AT YOUR OWN RISK! ⚠️

-----------------
When you close one window, the Catdra grows another head (cat)!

It's not much but a little test program using JOptionPane, pretty fun to run though!

There are 2 modes, and 5 different speeds for the auto mode

'K' to kill.

-----------------

SPEEDS:

Snail: 500ms delay

Fish: 250ms delay

Cat: 150ms delay

Cheetah: 50ms delay

Light: 0ms delay (Only limited by hardware)
